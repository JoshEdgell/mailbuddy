    <h1>Welcome to Easy Mailer</h1>
    <p>This is an automatic mailer app that I put together for sending form data from websites I've created.  Feel free to use it until I regret ever posting this thing because I've racked up some kind of weird Heroku charged I never knew existed.</p>

    <p>It's pretty easy, just send a GET request to https://easymailer.herokuapp.com/send with an object consisting of the following: { to: (email address), subject: (desired subject), text: (message text) }</p>

    <p>Emails will be sent from mistermailbuddy@gmail.com (I know, it's lame and I've been told it sounds sexual, but everything else that sounded relatably punny was taken)</p>
